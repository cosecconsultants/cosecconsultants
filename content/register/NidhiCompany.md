A Nidhi company closely resembles a Non-Banking Finance Company; however under a Nidhi Company, deposits may be accepted from the shareholders of the Nidhi Company. A Nidhi company is registered to borrow and lend to its shareholders to promote the habit of saving money among its shareholders and works on the principle of mutual help. These type of companies are registered as a public company and should have “Nidhi Limited” as the last words of its name. Nidhi Company is not required to receive the license from Reserve Bank of India (RBI), hence it is easy to form.
