A One Person Company is a paradigm shift in the Indian corporate regime, bringing it at par with global standards. Any Natural person who is an Indian citizen and resident in India shall be eligible to incorporate an OPC. It combines the features of sole proprietorship and a company. However, at the time of incorporation, an OPC must nominate a nominee director who will become the owner of the OPC in case the sole director is disabled. Also, a One Person Company must be converted into a Private Limited Company if it crosses an annual turnover of â‚¹2 crore and must file audited financial statements with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs at the end of each financial year like all types of companies. Therefore, it is essential for the entrepreneur to carefully consider the features of a One Person Company before incorporation.
