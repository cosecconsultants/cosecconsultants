A type of business organization where two or more persons come together to form a business and divide the profits thereof in an agreed ratio. Partnerships are a very good choice of business entity for small enterprises wherein two or more persons decides to contribute to a business and share the profits or losses. It can be registered or unregistered and can be even registered after formation. However, an unregistered firm cannot file a suit in any court against the firm or other partners for the enforcement of any right arising from a contract or right conferred by the Partnership Act. An unregistered firm or any of its partners cannot claim set off or other proceedings in a dispute with a third party.
