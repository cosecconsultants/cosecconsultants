 Corporate restructuring is an action taken by the corporate entity to significantly modify the capital structure or operations and to eliminate all the financial crisis and enhance the companyâ€™s performance. Generally, corporate restructuring happens when a corporate entity experiences significant problems and when it is in financial jeopardy. It can be driven by external factors requiring a change in the organizational structure or business model of an entity, or it can be driven by the necessity to make financial adjustments to its assets and liabilities. The process of restructuring is generally carried by way of mergers/amalgamations, acquisitions/takeovers, divestitures/demergers, slump sale, business sale; joint venture, strategic alliance, financial restructuring (buy-back, alteration & reduction). However, merger, amalgamation and demergers are commonly practiced as a means of corporate restructuring in India. Now, due to COVID 19 pandemic economies across the globe are under distress and have brought businesses in India at the verge of its closure. As an effective method to curb down the cost, many business organizations have planned to restructure their corporate entity.
